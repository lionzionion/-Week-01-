# -Week-01-
ðŸš€ Reflecting on My Coding Journey! ðŸš€

It's been an amazing year since I embarked on my coding journey, and I'm excited to share my progress from Week 1 of CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python. I've successfully completed five projects that showcase my growth as a programmer. Here's a quick overview of what I've accomplished:

Indoor Voice: Created a Python program that converts text to lowercase, giving it that cozy "indoor voice" vibe.

Playback Speed: In a file called playback.py, implement a program in Python that prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input, replacing each space with ... (i.e., three periods).

Making Faces: Explored ASCII art by generating fun facial expressions using different characters - a great way to bring out creativity!

Einstein: Delved into mathematical problem-solving, building a program to solve equations and equations - a taste of the genius himself!

Tip Calculator: Developed a user-friendly tip calculator for restaurant bills, providing a practical application of programming.

You can find all these projects for Week 01 in my GitHub repository at [insert link to your repository]. Feel free to explore, provide feedback, or even collaborate on projects! I'd love to hear your thoughts and suggestions.

I'm immensely grateful for the learning opportunities and support from the CS50 community and instructors. Each project came with its unique challenges, but I've relished every moment of it and grown as a programmer.

This past year has been an incredible journey, and I can't wait to see where the next year takes me. ðŸŒŸ #CS50 #PythonProgramming #LearningToCode #CodingJourney #Achievements
